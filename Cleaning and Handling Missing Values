In the IPL datasets, missing data can cause errors or biased analysis. 


For example:
The winner column may be missing when a match was abandoned or ended with no result.
Umpire columns might have some missing entries.

Handling these missing values properly ensures your analysis is accurate and meaningful.

Steps:
Detect missing values using .isnull().
For missing winner, replace with "No Result" to keep these matches in the dataset but mark them clearly.
For umpire info, if missing data is small and not essential, drop those rows to keep data clean.
Confirm no missing values remain.

Code Example
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
matches = pd.read_csv('matches.csv')

# 1. Check for missing values in the dataset
print("Missing values before cleaning:")
print(matches.isnull().sum())

# 2. Fill missing winners with 'No Result'
matches['winner'].fillna('No Result', inplace=True)

# 3. Drop rows with missing umpire info
matches.dropna(subset=['umpire1', 'umpire2'], inplace=True)

# 4. Verify missing values after cleaning
print("\nMissing values after cleaning:")
print(matches.isnull().sum())


Output youâ€™d expect:
Before cleaning, columns like winner, umpire1, and umpire2 have missing values.
After cleaning, missing winner entries are replaced with "No Result".
Rows with missing umpire data are dropped.
This results in no missing data in critical columns for your analysis.
