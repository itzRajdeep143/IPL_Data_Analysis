🏏 Examples in IPL Data Analysis
Here’s how appropriate chart choices apply to various IPL insights:

1. Team Performance – Total Wins
✅ Chart Type: Bar Chart

📌 Why: Best for comparing discrete quantities across teams.

2. Top Run Scorers / Wicket Takers
✅ Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart

📌 Why: Easily displays long player names; shows ranking clearly.


3. Matches per Season
✅ Chart Type: Line Chart or Bar Chart

📌 Why: Line chart shows trends over time; bar chart helps compare individual seasons.


4. Toss Winner vs Match Winner
✅ Chart Type: Grouped Bar Chart or Pie Chart

📌 Why: Grouped bar allows clear comparison of outcomes; pie shows win distribution.


5. Match Result Margins (Runs or Wickets)
✅ Chart Type: Histogram or Box Plot

📌 Why: Histogram shows frequency of various margin ranges; box plot shows distribution and outliers.


6. Run Distribution in a Match
✅ Chart Type: Histogram

8. Venue-wise Match Count
✅ Chart Type: Bar Chart or Map (Geo Chart)

📌 Why: Bar chart ranks venues; map helps geographically visualize match spread.


🚫 What to Avoid
❌ Using pie charts for too many categories (e.g., 10+ teams).

❌ Line charts for unordered categories (e.g., players).

❌ 3D charts – they distort data and reduce readability.
