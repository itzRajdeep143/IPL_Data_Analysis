This step involves creating clear, informative visualizations that summarize and communicate the most
important insights discovered during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Visuals help stakeholders quickly 
grasp patterns, trends, and outliers in the IPL dataset, making the analysis more accessible and actionable.

Purpose:
To summarize complex data in an understandable format.
To highlight key statistics and trends visually.
To support narrative insights with graphical evidence.
To detect and communicate anomalies or unusual observations.


Types of Visuals Used:
Bar Charts:

Showcasing top run scorers, most economical bowlers, or teams with highest wins.

Line Plots:

Illustrating trends across seasons, such as average runs per match or average wickets taken.

Boxplots:

Highlighting the distribution of scores or player performance metrics and revealing outliers.

Pie Charts:
Representing proportions, such as win shares among teams.
Heatmaps or Correlation Plots:
Visualizing relationships between different variables like runs scored and strike rate.
Example Visuals for IPL Data:
Top 5 Run Scorers Bar Chart — to identify the best batsmen overall.
Average Runs per Match Line Plot by Season — to show scoring trends.
First Innings Score Boxplot — to detect outliers and variability.
Pie Chart of Team Win Percentages — to visualize dominance among teams.
Economical Bowlers Bar Chart — highlighting bowlers with the lowest economy rate.


Sample Code Snippet (Bar Chart of Top 5 Run Scorers):
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

top_batsmen = deliveries.groupby('batsman')['batsman_runs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.barplot(x=top_batsmen.values, y=top_batsmen.index, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 5 Run Scorers in IPL')
plt.xlabel('Total Runs')
plt.ylabel('Batsman')
plt.show()


Types of Visualizations Used in IPL Data Analysis
1. Bar Charts
Use: To compare quantities across categories — e.g., top run scorers, most wins by teams.
Why: Easy to interpret, shows clear comparisons.

Example: Top 5 run scorers.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Top 5 run scorers
top_batsmen = deliveries.groupby('batsman')['batsman_runs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.barplot(x=top_batsmen.values, y=top_batsmen.index, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 5 Run Scorers in IPL')
plt.xlabel('Total Runs')
plt.ylabel('Batsman')
plt.show()

2. Line Plots
Use: To show trends over time — e.g., average runs per match over IPL seasons.
Why: Highlights patterns and changes clearly.

Example: Average runs per match by season.
# Average runs per match by season (using previously computed avg_runs_per_season)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.lineplot(data=avg_runs_per_season, x='season', y='total_runs', marker='o')
plt.title('Average Total Runs per Match Across IPL Seasons')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Runs')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

3. Boxplots
Use: To show data distribution and detect outliers — e.g., distribution of first innings scores.
Why: Summarizes spread, median, quartiles, and outliers visually.

Example: First innings scores distribution.
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.boxplot(x=first_innings_scores['total_runs'])
plt.title('Distribution of First Innings Total Scores (Outliers Highlighted)')
plt.xlabel('Total Runs')
plt.show()

4. Pie Charts
Use: To represent proportions — e.g., percentage of wins by different teams.
Why: Visually intuitive for parts-of-a-whole.

Example: Team win percentages.
win_counts = matches['winner'].value_counts()
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.pie(win_counts, labels=win_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=sns.color_palette('pastel'))
plt.title('Win Percentage by IPL Teams')
plt.show()

5. Heatmaps
Use: To visualize correlations or frequency across two dimensions — e.g., correlation between runs scored and strike rate.
Why: Quickly shows relationships and clusters.

Example: Correlation heatmap of numeric features.
import numpy as np

# Select relevant numeric features
stats = deliveries.groupby('batsman').agg({
    'batsman_runs': 'sum',
    'ball': 'count',
    'extra_runs': 'sum'
}).rename(columns={'ball': 'balls_faced'})

stats['strike_rate'] = (stats['batsman_runs'] / stats['balls_faced']) * 100

corr = stats[['batsman_runs', 'balls_faced', 'extra_runs', 'strike_rate']].corr()

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Batsman Stats')
plt.show()


Visuals Generated
I generated each of these graphs based on the IPL dataset you’re working with. Here are their descriptions:
Bar Chart: Shows the top 5 IPL batsmen by total runs scored.
Line Plot: Depicts the trend of average total runs scored per match season-wise.
Boxplot: Visualizes the spread and outliers in first innings total scores.
Pie Chart: Displays the proportion of match wins by IPL teams.
Heatmap: Presents correlation between different batting statistics.

Summary
By integrating these initial visualizations into the report or presentation, you provide a compelling and intuitive
overview of the IPL data insights. These graphics serve as a foundation for more advanced analyses or predictive modeling phases.
