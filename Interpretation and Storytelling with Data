🎯 What Does “Interpretation and Storytelling” Mean?
It’s not just about showing charts — it’s about telling a story using the data.

You're expected to:
Draw conclusions from the charts
Explain what the data means
Show trends, patterns, and insights
Answer real-world questions

📌 Think of this section as writing the “Insights Report” for someone who doesn’t know IPL data but wants to understand it easily.

3️⃣ Does winning the toss help?

4️⃣ Which seasons had high scoring trends?
