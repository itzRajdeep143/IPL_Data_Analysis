We used IPL datasets from Kaggle, which include:

matches.csv: Match-level data (teams, venue, toss winner, match result, etc.)

deliveries.csv: Ball-by-ball data (batsman, bowler, runs, wickets)

These datasets provide comprehensive coverage from IPL 2008 to 2022, making them ideal 
for exploring team and player performance, match outcomes, and trends across seasons.
The foundation of any data analysis project lies in selecting the right datasets. 
For analyzing IPL matches, you need datasets that comprehensively cover all aspects
relevant to your goals—such as match details, ball-by-ball data, player statistics, 
and team performances.

Key steps involved:
Understand the project objectives:
For IPL analysis, your goal might be to study team performance trends, player statistics, match outcomes,
or factors affecting match results.

Search for reliable data sources:
Use trusted platforms like Kaggle, official IPL websites, or cricket data repositories. Kaggle, for instance,
hosts well-structured IPL datasets collected over many seasons.

Dataset relevance and completeness:
Choose datasets that include essential features:
Match info: teams playing, venue, date, winner, toss winner, margin of victory.
Ball-by-ball data: runs scored on each ball, bowler, batsman, extras, wickets.
Player info if needed for detailed player analysis.

Verify data quality:
Preview datasets to ensure they cover multiple seasons (e.g., IPL 2008 to 2022) and have consistent, 
structured data ready for analysis.

Example:
For this project, we sourced two main datasets from Kaggle:
matches.csv — containing details of each IPL match, including participating teams, match result, venue, toss info, and season.
deliveries.csv — containing ball-by-ball data, capturing every ball bowled with runs scored, extras, and wickets.
This combination allows analysis at both the match and ball level, enabling comprehensive insights.
